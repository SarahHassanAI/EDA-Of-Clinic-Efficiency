# Clinic Operational Efficiency: A Data-Driven EDA to Slash Wait Times & Boost Patient Satisfaction
## Executive Summary:
Patient satisfaction scores were declining at a Dubai clinic due to **long wait times**, risking patient churn and revenue. Using Python and Power BI, I identified key bottlenecks in patient flow and developed a business action plan. The analysis reveals opportunities to **reduce average wait times from 22.1 to 15 minutes** and **increase patient satisfaction from 3.7 to 4.3 stars**, potentially protecting **AED 85,000+ in annual revenue**.

## The Business Problem:

Patient satisfaction is directly tied to clinic revenue and retention in **Dubai's competitive healthcare market**. Clinic stakeholders noticed satisfaction scores were declining (averaging 3.74/5) with 38.9% of patients experiencing long waits over 25 minutes. How can we determine where bottlenecks are occurring in the patient journey and make adjustments to improve patient satisfaction?

## Methodology 
Leveraging my background in clinical and insurance operations, I:

1. Developed a **Python ETL pipeline** to automate data cleaning & feature engineering

2. Created a **Power BI dashboard** to provide real-time visibility into clinic operations and KPI tracking

3. Performed statistical **modeling and bottleneck** **analysis** to identify pain points
   
_Note: For this project scope, a CSV file was used. In a production environment, a direct database connection (e.g., SQL) would be the scalable best practice._

## Skills

## Results & Business Recommendation
The data uncovered that **38.9% of patients experienced long waits (>25 min),** who had an average satisfaction score of only 2.95/5. Here’s how to fix it:

**Immediate** Action Plan **(0-3 Months)**:

**1. Resource Reallocation:** Assign additional support staff to Pediatrics during the high-volume afternoon slot.

 **2. Staff Training:** Roll out a time-management program for doctors with the longest average wait times.

  **3. Patient Communication:** Implement an SMS system to manage expectations when waits exceed 20 minutes.

Long-Term Initiatives **(6+ Months)**:

  1. **Develop a Predictive Staffing Model** using historical appointment patterns to optimize schedules.

  2. **Automate Pre-Consultation Processes** (e.g., digital check-in, insurance verification) to reduce front-desk congestion.

## Future Vision (Next Steps)

1.  A/B Test Interventions: Pilot the new scheduling system in one department and measure the impact on wait times.

2.  Build a Real-Time Dashboard: Transition from static reports to a live Power BI/Tableau dashboard for continuous monitoring of KPIs.

3.  Advanced Modeling: Incorporate machine learning for predictive wait time forecasting to enable proactive resource management.
